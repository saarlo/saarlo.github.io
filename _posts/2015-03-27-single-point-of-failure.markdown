With all the media coverage on Germanwings crash this week, I found one issue particularly puzzling - Why is it allowed to have only one person in cockpit when the room is lockable from inside. 
When you think about that, it strikes out as an obvious **single point of failure**. 

Everything planes, aviation and related protocols should be designed as **fault tolerant** system - At least I would assume (and hope) so.
The first rule of fault tolerance is [to eliminate single point of failures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance#Requirements)

Now what makes the matter frankly irritating is that there is existing precedent - 
[Crash of Mozambique Airlines in 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAM_Mozambique_Airlines_Flight_470) - 
same scenario - pilot locks out copilot and crashes the plane.
I would expect that accident with casualties initiates a proper review and validation of existing protocols and systems - all over the world - and "even if accident happened in Africa"  

Has to be said that in US and several other places it is required that at least 2 people are in cockpit. 

I could see why a pilot with past (but now known to be solved) stress issues is allowed to fly, but I think this above-described shortcoming that could
have been settled with few lines in protocols isn't gonna fly (a lame pun intent)
