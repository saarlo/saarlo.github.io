# Bringing moneyball to mats

A new project idea - a probabilistic model of [BJJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) match. Something like autocomplete feature - you did double under pass to side mount, went to mount, attempted americana now it is 80% likely that you go for s-mount and armbar or ... 

It's quite common practice in Natural Language Processing. Pretty much all that is needed is amount of detailed transcripts of bjj matches that would allow to build probabilistic model of BJJ flow. I doubt that this kind of thing exists though - maybe in Portuguese. Match commentators don't usually follow the flow in so detailed manner (or do they?). A video analyser that would extract the flow would be quite a cool project. And interestingly it is probably a huge benefit that in BJJ different color gis are common (not in judo?), that would make it easier to track 2 competitors separately. Again alternative approach for data collection would be gis that track techniques.

From analytics perspective this would be great - competitor specific probability models, different schools, alert systems etc. etc.

As [MMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) is (unfairly) much more popular sport with more money, then smart way would probably be to start from the octagon.
