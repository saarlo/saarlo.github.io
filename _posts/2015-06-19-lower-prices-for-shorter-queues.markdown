Was listening to NPR podcast [The Birth and Death of The Price Tag](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/06/17/415287577/episode-633-the-birth-and-death-of-the-price-tag) that explained the history of fixed price products (it is surprisingly recent thing) and current trend to move away from it. 

With multiple motivations for companies to dynamically change prices, then mostly the bottom line in private sector is to collect more profit. Then when government changes taxes the aim can also be to change behaviour of people (taxes on sugar, alcohol, tobacco etc.). 

Saw a series of articles covering the problem Estonian shopping malls have - lack of suitable workforce (can't find reference). With not enough people to man checkouts, queues grow on peak hours and nobody likes that. 

I wonder if anyone has tested off-peak-hour discounts to attract more people to do their shopping in slow hours. It should be straightforward to find out what items on discount would have best effect. Can you apply timely pricing strategy to most popular items? Can you classify people by contents of their shopping baskets and then guess their potential schedule based restrictions? What groups of shoppers jam the queue the most and what would motivate them to come to shop on different times?

This really sounds like already done somewhere ..
