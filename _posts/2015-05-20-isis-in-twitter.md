Found a great example of social media research thanks to [Partially Derivative](http://www.partiallyderivative.com/) podcast that I have been binge listening after discovering. [The ISIS Twitter Census](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/03/isis-twitter-census-berger-morgan). J.M. Berger and Jonathan Morgan have analysed thoroughly ISIS supporters activity in Twitter and effect that account suspensions have had on it. 

First half of the paper is fairly basic if you have any experience with social media analytics. It guides you through standard metrics and issues that come together with Twitter data. Section 3.8 and onwards has the coolness level turned up a notch though. It explains development of IQI metric used to detect ISIS supporters, brings in machine learning element, and gets into constraints of data availability.

Overall a good quality study, easy to follow and great introduction to Twitter data (and probably to works of ISIS pr machine as well :)). Fairly long read but worth to go through the whole article (downloadable as pdf).
