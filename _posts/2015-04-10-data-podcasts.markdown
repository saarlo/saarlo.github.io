I recently found a punch of new podcasts about data science and big data from [Favorite Podcasts thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9207360) in hacker news and iTunes recommendation engine worked pretty well too. 

Here's the list for reference:

- Talking Machines - had been listening that before, fairly technical covering articles, advanced concepts and interviews. I like to listen to it on commutes, when I have enough mind space to follow it
- Partially Derivative - New found. Weekly show covering data science news in very casual manner. It helps that hosts promote (drink) local beer during the podcast. Like it a lot - gives great overview about what's going on and is easy enough to follow so you can listen to it when jogging or swimming (goodos to my [waterfi](http://waterfi.com/waterproof-ipod-shuffle))
- Data Skeptic Podcast - Another easy to follow one. Mixes data science concepts and more in depth interviews. Less in depth than Talking Machines. Easy to follow but sometimes feels bit too basic.
- O'Reilly Data Show - Only listened to couple episodes there which where really good 
- More or Less: Behind the Stats - BBC radio show that takes a look at different issues from statistician perspective. Good quality, entertaining.
- Learning Machines 101 - have not yet listened (N/A)
- Data Stories - N/A
- Linear Digressions - N/A
